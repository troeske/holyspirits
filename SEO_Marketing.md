## Marketing Strategies

### Target Audience:

2. **Store owner** the owner of the site who is responsible for the inventory and offering of the site.
3. **Admin** the IT admin assigned by the store owner. For the small HolySpirits UG shop the role of store owner and admin are taken over by the same person - the store owner.


### SEO

In this release of our site we deployed several basic SEO strategies through Meta Tags (see above) and implementation of semantic structures in our html pages in order to improve our search ranking. In future releases of the site we will add additional features to boost our SEO performance (e.g. content marketing, affiliate marketing etc. - see below for details). 

### Content Marketing
In future releases we are planing to include a blog section for all things whiskey that will include original content as well as posts from known bloggers and news articles. Goal for this will be to convince users to come back to our site as it offers up to date and interesting articles about whiskey and adjacent topics (e.g. cocktails, mixology etc.). 

In addition we will allow shoppers to include tasting notes and comments on our whiskey inventory for the community.

### Social media marketing
Based on our user research (online articles, competitor analysis - see above - etc.) our target audience is using instagram and facebook as their main platform for social media marketing. Secondary platform will include tik tok and X to promote our site online. 

Main goal for our social media marketing is to get people to come to our site and signup for our newsletter and buy their whiskey on our store.

### Email marketing
based on the signup feature of our site

and incentives to signup with us (e.g. discounts on the first purchase, first access to new, rare releases etc.) we will create a database of shoppers and use this for a newsletter and other email based promotions. 

### Paid advertising
currently we do not plan to use paid ads at this point. This may come in later phases as part of our marketing strategies 

### Influencer marketing
currently we do not plan to use influencer marketing at this point. This may come in later phases as part of our marketing strategies 

### Affiliate marketing
